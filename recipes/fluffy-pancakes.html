  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
      Who doesn't love a nice lazy Sunday morning with a hot stack of delicious pancakes?
      Certainly that's my favorite way to start the day!
      This recipe is probably from <a href="http://www.allrecipes.com">Allrecipes.com</a> from waay back when.
      I would give credit where credit is due, but I wasn't able to find the recipe again!
      The idea to add chopped pecans comes from Cracker Barrel. It's a great way to add some wonderful nutty flavor.

      These pancakes are easy and quick to mix up. The buttermilk adds a nice touch to the traditional fluffy pancake.
      No need to have pancake mix in the pantry!
      But you will want to make sure that you have enough of your favorite toppings.
      For me, there has to be <em>plenty</em> of hot maple syrup, but maybe you want to try some jelly or even Nutella!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3/4 cups buttermilk (or you can use 2 1/4 tsp. lemon juice and enough milk to make 3/4 cup, if you don't have buttermilk handy)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tblsp. white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tblsp. butter, melted</li>
        <li>Fat for the frying pan (I use butter)</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> A dash of vanilla extract or vanilla-flavored sugar</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> A handful (or two!) of chopped pecans</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>If you don't have buttermilk, combine the milk and lemon juice and set aside while it thickens.</li>
          <li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Mix in vanilla-flavored sugar if desired.</li>
          <li>Whisk egg and melted butter into the buttermilk or soured milk in a separate mixing bowl.</li>
          <li>Pour the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk. Mix in chopped pecans and vanilla extract if desired.</li>
          <li>Pour the batter in 1/4 cupfuls in a large skillet over medium heat.
              It takes some practice turning pancakes just at the right moment, but I will say it's best to use lower heat to make sure the middle is done! </li>
      </ol>
