  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    A friend of mine made this delicious bulgur salad for a group of friends and we all enjoyed it so much!
    The key to why this recipe is <strong>so delicious</strong> is the pomegranate seeds and <em>tons</em> of fresh herbs.
    We often bring this salad to pot-luck functions and people really enjoy it!
    This recipe is from a German website that I can't find again, so again, sorry that I can't give credit where credit is due!
    But working with pomegranate can be pretty annoying.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've never had to get pomegranate seeds out of a pomegranate, here is the way I do it.
    First cut a thin slice of the top and bottom of the pomegranate off -- if you see red seeds you cut too much, but it's not a problem!
    Then, following the lines in the skin of the pomegranate, score the skin of the pomegranate so that you have six roughly equal sized pieces.
    Again, you only want to cut through the skin, not so far in that you cut through the seeds.
    At this point you should be able to break the fruit apart at the scored lines you've made.
    From there you just have to be careful and pick the seeds out.
    I do this over a full bowl of cold water. That way you can separate out the little bits of skin more easily.
    And it's always a good idea to rinse the seeds before you add them!

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
    Again, since this is from a German website all the measurements are in the <strong>metric system</strong>.
    Feel free to make adjustments here! You can really add whatever you like -- include bell peppers, different kinds of herbs, <em>whatever</em>!
