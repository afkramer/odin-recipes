  <p>When the weather turns cooler and we get to fall and winter, I really love eating soup.
    I'm usually way too cold, so I cherish the warmth that a bowl of soup brings.
    This recipe also comes from a German website, I think, but has been in our recipe book so long I can't find the source!</p>
  <p>I love that this recipe includes ginger. That is my go-to ingredient during the colder months to bolster my immune system.
    The lime and coconut milk bring in some additional interesting flavors, and is also probably why this recipe is called "Hawaiian Carrot Soup"!
    Feel free to get creative with the toppings. I love a little bit of crunch on top of a nice thick soup.

    <ol>
      <li>In a large pot, melt some butter and cook the onions and ginger until the onions are slightly see-through.</li>
      <li>Add the carrots and potatoes to the pot and simmer for another few minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the vegetable broth and simmer for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Blend the soup using an immersion blender until all chunks are gone.</li>
      <li>Add the coconut milk and heat up again.</li>
      <li>Add honey, salt, pepper, lime juice and cayenne pepper to taste.</li>
      <li><em>Optional</em>: You can add so many different things to the top! Fried potato pieces, nuts, sour cream, even bacon pieces if you like!
        But in our household freshly chopped cilantro is a must!</li>
