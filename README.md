# odin-recipes
A simple website with recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project.
Since I briefly learned HTML a long time ago, for me it was a good refresher on the different HTML elements.

After this project, I am much more solid on the boilerplate for HTML files, can create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and ordered and unordered lists.
